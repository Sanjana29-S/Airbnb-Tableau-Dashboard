# AirBnB Tableau Dashboard
# 📊 From Raw Airbnb Data to Investment Decisions | Tableau Dashboard

If someone wanted to start an Airbnb business, the real question isn’t:

> **“Can I rent this property?”**

It’s:

> **👉 Where should I buy, how should I configure the property, and what revenue can I realistically expect?**

To answer this, I built an **Airbnb analytics dashboard in Tableau** focused on turning listing data into **actionable, data-backed investment insights**.

## 🔍 Business Problem

New Airbnb hosts often rely on intuition when making decisions around:
- Location
- Number of bedrooms
- Expected pricing
- Revenue potential

This dashboard replaces guesswork with **data-driven insights** to support smarter investment decisions.

## 📈 What the Dashboard Analyzes

- **Average nightly price by bedroom count**  
  → Understand pricing power as property size increases

- **Supply distribution by bedroom type**  
  → Analyze competition across different property configurations

- **Average price by zip code**  
  → Identify high-performing neighborhoods

- **Zip code price ranking**  
  → Compare locations side by side

- **Revenue trends over time**  
  → Identify seasonality and demand patterns

## 🎯 Use Case

This dashboard helps answer a critical investor question:

> *“If I buy a property today, which area and configuration gives me the best chance of maximizing revenue?”*
